### Hi there 👋

- 🔭 I’m currently working on _React.js_ and _React Native_ applications powered by _GraphQL_. I also partially work on creation of REST APIs using Spring Boot 😄

- 🌱 I’m currently learning CSS (it never ends), Next.js, and a little bit of Math for programming 😅😅

- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on any open-source applications that has <ins>**JavaScript**</ins> in it 🥰

-    💁‍♂️ I want to help developers starting with JavaScript, React.js, React Native, GraphQL or anything related to them. I can review your code, guide you, help you write better code. 

- 🤔 I’m looking for help with writing custom React _Hooks_ and _CSS_ animations

- 💬 Ask me about React.js, React Native, JavaScript, VSCode, Theme, [hyper.js](https://hyper.is/) (customizations, etc...), oh-my-zsh, Songs, Football (American Soccer), and Android.
